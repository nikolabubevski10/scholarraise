## Scholar Raise

Scholar Raise is a crowdfunding service that helps you save for your child's future college education. This repository is the web application for Scholar Raise, which was built on top of a clean [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) installation and uses the [sr-component](https://github.com/scholarraise/sr-components) library for components.

### Installing

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:scholarraise/scholar-raise-client.git
$ cd scholar-raise-client
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

If things worked out as they should, the web app is available locally on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

## Deployment
